# Aloha, folks!
#### Welcome to the main page for my learning analytics projects.

My name is **Zhongyuan(Noah) Zhang**, an M.S. candidate for Learning Analytics at **Columbia University**. **LEARNING ANALYTICS** is the measurement, collection, analysis and reporting of data about learners and their contexts, for purposes of understanding and optimising learning and the environments in which it occurs. The program prepares me with experience and practise of data science methods to cater education releated exploration. The insights extracted from series of analysis could either directly or indirectly merit design and implementation, evaluation and assessment, upgrade and optimization in instructional design, education product  as well as learning interace/ learning experience.
